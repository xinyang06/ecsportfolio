	  My favorite food is rubber and my least favorite food is steel. My dental bills exceed the wealth currently stored in the American economy, and my bones are as flexible as a car tire. I rarely eat steel, or any metal, so I am consistently battling anemia and the urge to pass out every time I stand up. I snack on ice in place of steel and red meat. I am technically vegetarian and vegan. For this reason, I am terrible to be around at dinner parties. My parents raised me on organic cow's milk, but I eventually developed a lactose intolerance due to genetics, and I started chewing on the rubber from the legs of my crib. I prefer fresh rubber, so I run a rubber plantation. I go into the fields and have a snack every morning, midday, and night. My plumbing bills are also sky-high, but I use industrial grade hydrochloric acid to melt anything that can't be processed by the sewage system. Despite my efforts, I still have to get my pipes replaced monthly because of the sheer amount of rubber I consume.
