	  <p>My favorite food is rubber and my least favorite food is steel. My dental bills exceed the wealth currently stored in the American economy, and my bones are as flexible as a car tire. I rarely eat steel, or any metal, so I am consistently battling anemia and the urge to pass out every time I stand up. I snack on ice in place of steel and red meat. I am technically vegetarian and vegan. For this reason, I am terrible to be around at dinner parties. My parents raised me on organic cow's milk, but I eventually developed a lactose intolerance due to genetics, and I started chewing on the rubber from the legs of my crib. I prefer fresh rubber, so I run a rubber plantation. I go into the fields and have a snack every morning, midday, and night. My plumbing bills are also sky-high, but I use industrial grade hydrochloric acid to melt anything that can't be processed by the sewage system. Despite my efforts, I still have to get my pipes replaced monthly because of the sheer amount of rubber I consume. </p>
	  <p>My interpersonal relations are, by far, the worst aspect of my life. Due to the exorbitant amount of rubber I ate as a kid, my parents couldn't fund my appetite. I resorted to chewing on the rubber from car tires on the street, and I developed the strongest immune system known to man. Various studies were conducted on me, but no scientist could extract an accurate read on my body mass because my diet was so consumed by rubber. The rubber defined my skin consistency, so during strong gusts, I wave back and forth, similar to the balloon men in front of a car dealership. This made taking an accurate sample from my being virtually impossible, so science could never truly understand what my genetic composition contains. I earned substantial amounts of money from these dead-end studies, of which my parents always confiscated to "safekeep" for me. However, when I reached 18, I went to my parents to re-claim my monetary assets. To my shock, my horror, my own family had used the money to fund the impossible amounts of rubber I eat. In my fury, my body developed IBS, and I steadily blew up with gas. My rubber skin allowed for my body to take on a balloon-esque figure, and I eventually knocked everything off the dinner table and shattered all the fine china my mother had been collecting since the 1800's. In fact, we had the very same plate that Lincoln fell on in that theater, face first. I broke it in my gas-filled daze, which caused my mother to erupt in tears. I tried to run away in my despair, but I ended up taking close to an hour trying to squeeze through the doorframe. My last interaction with my parents resulted in disaster. And so, my interpersonal relations are the worst part of my life.</p>
	  <p>Despite all of these hurdles from my diet, I have continued to perservere. The taste, the texture, the scent- rubber provides everything my parents couldn't. Rubber, in all its glory, vastly outweighs anything that family could give me. Rubber outweighs everything. In fact, American President Biden once approached me to ask if I could become a CIA agent. When I asked if I could still consume rubber on the job, Biden told me that, "It's not human-like" and "You're literally insane", and "How are you alive". This hateful speech simply fueled my love for rubber; we are a forbidden pairing. We are the Romeo and Juliet of the culinary world. Me and my rubber, me and Michelin Tires, me and my crib legs. </p>
